SORandom is collection of pseudorandom generators from various statistical distributions and functions for pseudorandom array sampling.

## Installation

SORandom is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SORandom"
```

##Sampling functions:

* Sampling with replacement
* Sampling without replacement
* Sampling with replacement with given weights		 	

##How to use it?

```swift
import SORandom

//Single pseudorandom normal variable
//with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
let x = randNormal(0, 1)

//Array of pseudorandom independent normal variables
//with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 and length 10
let sample = randNormals(0, 1, 10)

//Sampling from array:

//with replacement
let numbers = [10, 11, 45, 1, 0, 4]
let bootstrapSample = sampleWithReplacement(numbers, 10)

//without replacement
let names = ["John", "Bob", "Anna", "Alice", "Chris", "Luke"]
let usersOrder = sampleWithoutReplacement(names, 4)

//with given weights
let letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
let probabilities = [0.5, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3]

let randomLetters = sampleWithWeights(letters, probabilities, 10)
```
